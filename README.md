# Library Managment System (GUI)
The library contains tens of thousands of books and members which must be organized in order to prevent chaos. We wrote JAVA program that allows performance of the actions needed to manage the library in a simple and comfortable way.  

**The actions will include:**  
1- Addition/Removal of Books 
2- Addition/Removal of Members 
3- Member and Book Searches 
4- Rent Book 
5- Reserve a place in a Rent queue for a certain book 

The system will support two different types of users. 
**Librarians:** 
1- Addition/Removal of a book from the library 
2- Addition/Removal of a user from the library 
3- Search for books or members 
4- Addition/Removal of users from Book- Order (Rent) list 
5- Blocking of users who return books late 
6- Rent a book. 

**Readers:** 
1- Searching of books or users 
2- Addition of self to Book- Order (Rent) list 
3- Rent a book 

For each user (reader/librarian) exists a unique Id and password, this allows an unambiguous recognition of the user, so that the system can prevent from users access to information which they are not allowed to access. 
Person should have (ID,Password,Type,FirstName,LastName,Address,CellPhone,Email,isBlocked).
